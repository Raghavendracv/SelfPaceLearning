Learning Journal with code samples in Golang

Please feel free to contribute to code samples and propose different approaches to solve the porblems.

I want to solve each problem using at least three different approahces and benchmark them.

## To Do ##

**AreOneEquidistant**
* Update approaches description.
* Implement different approaches(Two more to go).
* Reuse test table for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**MaxRemainder**
* Refactort tests to Table-Driven Test.
* Implement different approaches(Two more to go).
* Reuse test table for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**MinimumElementFrequency**
* Refactort tests to Table-Driven Test.
* Implement different approaches(Two more to go).
* Reuse test table for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**MinElementSum**
* Update approaches description.
* Implement different approaches(Three more to go).
* Write Table-Driven test for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**MinOperationsToMoveUpperThanLower**
* Update approaches description.
* Implement different approaches(Three more to go).
* Write Table-Driven test for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**MinSumAfterReplaceTwoWithSum**
* Update approaches description.
* Implement different approaches(Three more to go).
* Write Table-Driven test for different implementations.
* Benchmark different implementations.

**SubArrayWithGivenSum** 
* Update approaches description.
* Implement different approaches(Three more to go).
* Write Table-Driven test for different implementations.
